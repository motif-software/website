## An encyclopedia of software components

Metro is so named because the content of the encyclopedia is represented as a graph. To “use” the encyclopedia, you traverse from a concept of interest down a ladder of abstraction to one or more concrete implementations that meet a set of criteria.

## Features
- An extensive catalog of software system components, from enterprise incumbents to curious startups.
- Each component comes with a description and examples of its use.
- The Metro Newsletter announces the addition of new services, so you can be the first in the know.
