Project visualisation and management tool.

## Concepts
- Tasks naturally form a graph, so present them as one
- Task graphs have hierarchy across multiple dimensions (e.g. ordering, projects, assignment, status, etc.). Allow simple, snappy switching between them.
- Real-time local changes, optimistic updates and syn to backends.

## Backends
Support popular task management tools. Bias towards simple and enterprise tools.
- Jira
- Trello
- Google/Apple tasks
