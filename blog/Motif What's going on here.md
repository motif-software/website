With [[Motif Software]], I want to build a theory of the case for a new style of software development, something I'm calling [[High-Altitude Software and Test Engineering]].

I'm a software engineer with a passion. I live for the art and craft of building software. The full spectrum of tools and techniques, platforms and politics, the emotions, the successes and the failures.

I have a lot of thoughts and I want to cover a lot of ground. I'll present some [[Motif Concepts]] from the software industry, explain [[Motif Mission]] and [[Motif Principles]], and tie theory to practice with some [[Motif Examples|examples]]. Most of all, I want to introduce some novel ideas and open the doors to a new generation of software engineers.

This has been a long time coming, so an initial dump of thoughts will be followed by a process of incremental refinement.

I also want to keep it short and to-the-point (a constant struggle). So, until next time.
